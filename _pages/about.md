I currently work as a software engineer at Google Research. I obtained my PhD degree from the University of California Merced, under the guidance of Prof. [Ming-Hsuan Yang](http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang/).
Before that, I obtained my M.S. degree at School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University in 2018
and B.S. degree at Taishan College, Shandong University in 2015.

I am interested in computer vision, deep learning, and machine learning.
More specifically,
- Vision-Language Models
- Semantic Correspondence
- Self-Supervised Representation Learning
- Optical Flow
- Generative Adversarial Networks
- Disentangled Representation Learning
- Privacy-Preserving Visual Recognition
